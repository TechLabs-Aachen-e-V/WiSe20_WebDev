2. Create seed data in mongo database
    Run --> npm seeds/index
    It should create the database locals-aachen in mongo --> If something doesn't work here I forgot a step; 
    just let me know and I'll research what you else you need to do.
    Creates 50 seed cards in database
    
3. Enter database in mongo
    You can find the mongo.exe in the folder bin in the programme folder created when doing the download. 
    Open the programme and you'll be in the mongo terminal
    Here you can see all databases with the command --> show dbs
    If the database got created (see step 2) you should find locals-aachen among the databases
    To enter the database use --> use locals-aachen
    You are now in the correct database.
    To see all the events use --> db.events.find()
    It will open all the events that you created. I called them "events" to make it easier. To open more events type --> it

4. Run the server
    To run the server navigate to the folder where you saved your git local repository. Here you run the command --> nodemon server.js
    In the last two lines it should show --> Listening on port 3000!
                                             Database connected
    Now enter your browser and type --> localhost:3000/events
    Congrats! The server is running and should show the created events on the cards.
